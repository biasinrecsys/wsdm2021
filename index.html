                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p> Ranking and recommender systems are playing a key role in today's online platforms, definitely influencing the <strong>information-seeking behavior</strong> of tons of users.
                    However, these systems are trained on data which often conveys <strong>imbalances and inequalities</strong>, and such patterns might be captured and emphasized in the results
                    the system provides to the final users, creating exposure biases and providing unfair results. Given that biases are becoming a <strong>threat to information seeking</strong>,
                    (i) studying the interdisciplinary concepts and problem space, (ii) formulating and designing a bias-aware algorithmic pipeline, and (iii) materializing and
                    <strong>mitigating the effects of bias</strong>, while retaining the effectiveness of the underlying system, are rapidly becoming prominent and timely activities.</p>
                <p> The proposed tutorial is organized around this topic, presenting the WSDM community with <strong>recent advances</strong> on the assessment and the mitigation of
                    <strong>data and algorithmic bias</strong> in recommender systems. We will first introduce conceptual foundations, by surveying the state of the art and describing real-world examples
                    of how a bias can impact <strong>recommendation algorithms</strong> from several perspectives (e.g., ethics and system's objectives). The tutorial will continue with a systematic
                    presentation of algorithmic solutions to uncover, assess, and reduce bias along the recommendation design process. A <strong>practical part</strong> will then provide attendees
                    with concrete implementations of pre-, in-, and post-processing bias mitigation algorithms, leveraging open-source tools and public datasets. In this part,
                    tutorial participants will be engaged in the design of the bias countermeasures and in articulating <strong>impacts on stakeholders</strong>. We will finally conclude
                    the tutorial with an analysis of the emerging open issues and future directions in this vibrant and rapidly evolving research area.</p>

                <h2>Target Audience</h2>

                <p>This tutorial is accessible to <strong>researchers</strong>, <strong>industry technologists</strong> and <strong>practitioners</strong>. For people not familiar
                    with rankings, this tutorial covers necessary <strong>background material</strong>. No prior knowledge on bias is assumed. Basic knowledge of Python programming
                    and of quite common libraries, such as Pandas and NumPy, is preferred but not strictly necessary.</p>

                <p>After this tutorial, <strong>attendees will be able to</strong> understand key aspects of bias in personalized rankings, materialize biases into underlying systems,
                    play with mitigation and articulate impacts on stakeholders, identify challenges and opportunities.</p>

                                    <li><strong>Techniques for bias treatment</strong>. We will present the three main classes of mitigation techniques (pre-, in-, and post-processing), along with examples of solutions proposed for recommender systems.</li>
